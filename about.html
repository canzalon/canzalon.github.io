                <p>
                    Sometimes I’m so heavy with “What’s the matter?” turned in upon itself with so much gravity that I collapse. I’m intent on keeping that border between my center and your edges, but I erupt beneath my skin and reflect inward until life’s light can not escape. I am entrapped. Do not come near my bed, or my mood will snare and stretch you until you’re so long that no nerve will be able to connect your feet to your head. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will no longer be able to live, pulled thinner than angel hair, wrenched so thin that you have no end. Do not come near my bed. I’m not part of your universe. To that, I’m dead. My hurt, now in concentrate, attracts debris, which swirls round and round my emotional drain like water sucked from a sink. Don’t worry. It wasn’t fit to drink. Things speed from the threshold of seeing towards me, but I’ve got near vision and can no longer see those which move on the far side. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Straps of words, wrap, then numb me, and so I tire, refuse to bear the weight of air, and, exhausted, slip into the alternative reality. Finally I forget that I was known only to myself, and come to rest, dense, in an urn above the fireplace.
