                    <p>
                        Hey there. I just graduated from university this past spring semester
                        with a bachelors in computer science, and am currently looking for work. 
                        I am kind of hoping this pathetic excuse for a website will help in my 
                        efforts for finding employment post-graduation, along with posting my
                        projects worked on during my time at uni. To be honest, I have not been
                        as proactive in jump-starting my career as most, mostly due to personal
                        issues, but am now making the best effort I can. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite fitting the stereotype of the socially awkward engineering
                        major quite well via my social anxiety disorder, I do my best to be 
                        a friendly, social, and open personality when the situation calls for
                        it. My friends describe me as compassionate, a good listener,
                        conversationalist, and even an "emotional being." Though I may be
                        sensitive, I typically am if the situation calls for it. One of
                        my favorite things to do is joke around and be generally comedic about
                        anything and everything, even some of the darkest things of life. For some of us, it's how we cope. In other words, I love to laugh. :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're an employer, I hope I haven't scared you away with my 
                        auto-bio; I'd rather be honest about myself, it's easier that way. 
                        Please check out some of my sample code by going to my portfolio and
                        following the github links to the projects, or, you can just click the "github repo" link to the left. And, of course, there's also that link
                        to my resume. Thank you for taking the time to read this and considering
                        me. If anything, I don't mind making new friends so feel free to contact me, if you wish! :)
                    </p>
